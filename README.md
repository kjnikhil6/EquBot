Two wheeled self balancing Robot is a foremost resarch topic in the area of
robotics and control engineering.The principal of operation behind a self bal-
ancing robot is an inverted pendulum cocept.The major focus on this project is
the hardware development of two wheeled self balancing robot for an applica-
tion to carry object from one place to another.The modelling of self balancing
robot is done in terms of inverted pendulum.Since the two wheeled self balanc-
ing robot has some inherent characteristics like instability,non linearity type of
controller like LQR is used.A LQR controller is incorporated in the hardware
section to improve and ensure a good performance for the system.
